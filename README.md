# E01a-Control-Structues
I took a copy of an original repostory and made changes to it. Here in these files I have answered questions about the files and what happens to them when you add code. I changed different parts the the code on diffenet files to find out the outcome of each adjustment. I made all the changes i needed and sent it back to github so that it may be viewed.
